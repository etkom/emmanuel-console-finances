## Description

This is a code to analyze the financial records of a company with a dataset provided. The brief required me to compute:
1. The total number of months
2. Average change
3. Greatest increase in profit/loss
4. Greatest decrease in profit/loss

This code provides the company with insights and a general overview of how the business is doing in order to know where to make changes.
In the course of writing these codes, i learnt the importance of pseudocoding and having an understanding of what you are trying to do. In this case, i had to research some financial terms and refresh my knowledge on the subject
